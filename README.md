## Dependencies

- `clang++` (OpenMP should be available)
- [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (usually copied to `/usr/include`)
- `libboost-dev`
- Eigen 3 (`libeigen3-dev`)
- You should have a symlink to `clang++` called `clang-omp++` on Linux-based systems. This is to ease the use for mac users, since they can rely on a more OpenMP-compliant version through brew.
